## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Visual Automation Builder** - Node-based editor like n8n, with drag & drop
- 🤖 **AI-Native** - First-class AI actions (summarize, classify, extract, generate)
- 🔒 **Privacy-First** - All data stays local, no cloud required
- ⚡ **Fast & Lightweight** - Built with Go + React, minimal resource usage
- 🌙 **Dark Mode** - Beautiful dark UI by default

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Node.js 20+
- [Wails CLI](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation)

### Development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ForgeFlow.git
cd ForgeFlow

# Run in development mode (hot reload)
wails dev
```

### Build

```bash
# Build production binary
wails build
```

The binary will be in `build/bin/`.

### Version Management

To update the app version:

1. Edit `version.json` and change the version number
2. Run `node scripts/sync-version.js`

This automatically updates:
- `wails.json` (productVersion)
- `frontend/package.json` (version)
- `app.go` (version string)
- `build/splash.html` (version display)
- `frontend/src/version.ts` (auto-generated constant for React components)

## 🧩 Node Types

### Triggers
- **File Trigger** - React to file changes
- **Schedule** - Cron or interval-based
- **Webhook** - HTTP receiver
- **Manual** - Button press
- **System** - App/process events

### Actions
- **File Ops** - Move, rename, delete files
- **HTTP Request** - Call external APIs
- **Shell Command** - Run system commands (sandboxed)
- **Notify** - Desktop notifications

### AI Actions
- **Summarize** - AI-powered summaries
- **Classify** - Categorize content
- **Extract** - Pull out entities/data
- **Rewrite** - Transform text
- **Generate** - Create new content
- **Custom Prompt** - Your own AI prompts
